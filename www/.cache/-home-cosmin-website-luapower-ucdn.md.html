<p>A ffi binding of <a href="https://github.com/grigorig/ucdn">UCDN</a>.</p>
<p>UCDN is a Unicode support library. Currently, it provides access to basic character properties contained in the Unicode Character Database and low-level normalization functions (pairwise canonical composition/decomposition and compatibility decomposition). More functionality might be provided in the future, such as additional properties, string normalization and encoding conversion.</p>
