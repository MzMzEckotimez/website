<p>I learned to program in 5<sup>th</sup> grade on a Z80, and later on on a 486 and never stopped since. I got my first paying job at 17 when I wrote an online shop in php.</p>
<p>I write my code in Lua when I can, in Python and Javascript when I can't, and in Java, C++, C# and ObjC when I get paid. Sometimes I meet people who use C for everything, and then I move on.</p>
<p>In the past I did a lot of Delphi in smokey apartment-sized companies full of smart people, and then more Delphi in mall-sized corporations full of marketing droids and a one-hour commute. I even worked in a php farm for one month.</p>
<p>My last punching-card job was at <a href="http://sellerengine.com/">SellerEngine</a> where I developed products for large amazon sellers.</p>
<p>I currently live in Bucharest, and work as a freelancer.</p>
<p>My most significant project to date is luapower, the place which gets most of the output of my current research interests, which include vector graphics, GUIs, and p2p networks (I secretly dream of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY">putting them all together</a> one day).</p>
<p>I am a market anarchist and a philosopher. I value peaceful parenting and animal welfare and I owe my current education to Ayn Rand, Stefan Molyneux, Ludwig Von Mises, Robert P. Murphy, Frank Lloyd Wright, Christopher Alexander, Douglas Engelbart and others.</p>
