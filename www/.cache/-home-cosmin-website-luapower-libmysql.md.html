<p>libmysql is the official mysql client library that you can use with the <a href="/mysql">mysql</a> binding.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative description:</strong> Libmysql is a 6 (six) Megabyte pile of C++ for what is essentially a networking protocol. It will infect all your code with GPL, and is also a blocking API. All in all, a marvelous piece of engineering. Well, you can at least solve the GPL problem with <a href="/libmariadb">libmariadb</a>, which mostly works, with some exceptions, see mysql_test.lua.</p>
